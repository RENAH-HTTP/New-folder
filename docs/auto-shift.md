Auto Shift is a real-time pitch tracking and correction effect made for **monophonic audio** (with a inclination towards vocal recordings and samples). It can receive pitch information in two main ways:

- **Scales** - you define in the device (Quantizer)
- **MIDI notes** - coming from another track (MIDI sidechain), which could be helpgul for harmonies and pitch control.

### Usage 

Auto Shift is categorized in the new version of Live as an **Audio Effect**. It can work best when added to an audio track that contains a clear pitched signal (voice, monophonic synth lead, bass, etc.).

1. Drag **Auto Shift** onto an audio track.
2. In the **Input** section, you can choose a **Pitch Range** (High / Mid / Bass) that matches the source.
3. Next, you can use one of the correction modes:
	 - **Quantizer**: pick a Root + Scale (or select included notes), then adjust **Correction Strength**.
	 - **MIDI**: enable **MIDI In**, choose a MIDI track as the source, and play notes to control the correction.
4. Set **Dry/Wet** to balance natural vs corrected sound.

### Input - Pitch Tracking and Latency

The Input section is where you optimize tracking before you touch “tuning” parameters.

- **Input Pitch** shows the detected notes in letter notation and cents. 
- **Pitch Range (High / Mid / Bass)** selects the expected input range, making the detection more reliable.
- **Input Gain (-24 to +24 dB)** trims the signal incoming into the detector.
- **Latency** is displayed in milliseconds.
- **Live Mode** (toggle in the title bar) reduces latency for performance, but can introduce gltiches depending on how fast the pitch changes

### Quantizer Mode - Scale-Based Correction)

Quantizer corrects incoming audio to the notes of a defined scale.

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Correction Strength** | How strongly the audio is corrected to reach the target note |
| **Smooth** | Changes the interpolation time for more less artifacts - rannging from 0ms to 200ms|
| **Root & Scale** | Changes the target musical scale the device should reach |
| **Included Notes** | Lets you build a custom scale by enabling/disabling notes |
| **Pitch Shift (scale degrees)** | Transposes the sound *after* correction, while maintaining the target key |

If **Use Current Scale** is enabled in the device title bar, Auto Shift will follow the active clip scale selected in the session (“scale awareness”), and the scale’s notes will be highlighted.

### MIDI Mode (Pitch Correction from Notes)

When you enable **MIDI In**, Auto Shift switches to using incoming MIDI data to determine the target pitch instead of using the scale established in the Quantizer.

- Choose the **External Source** (the MIDI track sending notes)
- Choose the **Tapping Point** (Pre FX / Post FX / Post Mixer)
- Choose a voice mode:
	- **Mono**: one note at a time (includes **Glide** for sliding between note values)
	- **Poly**: up to **8 voices** (2 / 4 / 8) for harmonization

**Important**: If MIDI Input is to be enabled, Auto Shift will only output audio when it is receiving MIDI notes.

### LFO Tab (Modulation)

Auto Shift includes an LFO that can modulate the following values: **Pitch**, **Formant**, **Volume**, and **Pan**.

- **Reset** can retrigger the LFO at onsets (pitch detection onsets in Quantizer mode, or note onsets in MIDI mode)
- **Delay / Attack** shapes how the LFO fades in and fades out
- **Waveform** offers multiple shapes (including stepped, sample and hold and random variants)
- **Rate** can run free or sync to tempo

The LFO will affects the incoming signal whether or not pitch correction is enabled.

### Pitch and Formant Shifting

You can use pitch and formant controls for “tuned” effects *or* as a creative pitch/formant shifter.

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Pitch Shift (semitones & cents)** | Transposes the signal with the option **fine** in order to tune it in cents|
| **Formant Shift (-100% to 100%)** | Changes tonal and timbral character without changing perceived pitch |
| **Formant Follow** | Links formant movement to pitch movement for more natural results |

---

### Vibrato

Vibrato is useful for subtle motion or “harder” pitch effects.

- **Amount**: 0–200 cents
- **Rate**: 2–15 Hz
- **Fade In**: how quickly the vibrator reaches it target value
- **Natural Vibrato** adds small variations for a more organic feel

The **Dry/Wet** control also lives here. At **50%**, you can create a simple doubler-style blend between dry and processed signals.

### FAQ

**Does Auto Shift work on chords or full mixes?**

It’s mainly designed for monophonic sources. Polyphonic material can confuse pitch detection; for harmonies, please use MIDI input (Poly) to generate more controlled results.

**Why is there latency?**

Auto Shift analyzes pitch in real time - therefore tracking introduces latency. The way to mediate this is by using Live Mode which can reduce latency for performance.

**Why do I get no output in MIDI mode?**

With MIDI input enabled, Auto Shift only produces sound while it receives MIDI notes. Check the MIDI source routing and make sure notes are being sent.

#### Changelog

| Version | Change |
|---|---|
| **12.1.5** | In Auto Shift, MPE pitch bend now uses a 48 semitones range. Fixed a bug that caused phasing artifacts in Auto Shift when MIDI Input was turned off while notes were still playing. Mapping the Scale and Root parameters to a Rack’s Macro Controls now works as expected in the Scale, Arpeggiator, and Auto Shift devices. |
| **12.1** | First release of Auto Shift |
